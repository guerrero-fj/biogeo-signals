# Document Outline: Conceptual Framework for Biogeochemical Signals

This document formalizes the theoretical scaffold for analyzing biogeochemical 
signals using information geometry, constrained fluctuation theory, 
and observer-relative inference. It integrates Prigogine’s triadic framework 
(structure, fluctuation, function), builds on signal-as-constraint logic, 
and provides a bridge from empirical data (e.g., sediment cores, PSDs, DOC) to 
system-level inference.

## 1. Introduction

* Why biogeochemical signals matter
* Limitations of traditional output-based or model-centric approaches
* Introducing the shift: from deterministic state models to probabilistic constraint geometry
* Core proposition: **Signals are constrained fluctuations, not deterministic outputs**

## 2. Prigogine’s Trinomial Recast for Biogeochemical Systems

### 2.1 Structure–Fluctuation–Function

* Define each element in the context of watershed biogeochemistry
* Their mutual co-generation and dynamic interplay
* Extended triadic closure:

  * Function = Structure + Fluctuation
  * Structure = Function + Fluctuation
  * Fluctuation = Structure + Function

### 2.2 Functional Irreversibility

* Functional reorganization post-disturbance
* How system function (e.g., carbon export) can encode structural transformation
* Why time-reversibility assumptions fail in ecological systems

## 3. Signals as Projections of Constraint Evolution

### 3.1 Signal = Observed Probability Distribution Over Time

* PSD, DOC, DSi as examples
* Each signal is a distribution shaped by the system’s structural constraints and functional dynamics

### 3.2 Manifold Embedding

* $\{p_t\} \subset \mathcal{M} \subset \Delta^n$: signal trajectory in statistical space
* Geometry of $\mathcal{M}$: defined by feasible constrained states
* Divergence, entropy, and curvature as indicators of system evolution

## 4. Entropy and Divergence Recast

### 4.1 Beyond the Second Law

* Classical view: entropy = ignorance
* Prigogine-GEUP view: entropy = structural evolution
* Implication: entropy change can mark bifurcations or reorganizations

### 4.2 Divergence Asymmetry as Directionality

* KL(p || q) ≠ KL(q || p) implies time-asymmetric transformation
* Use as empirical detector of constraint reordering

## 5. The Role of the Observer

* Observation is embedded, not external
* Measurement constraints are part of the system’s structure
* Introduce: **Embedded Inference Principle**

  * $\mathcal{C}_{\text{observer}} \cap \mathcal{C}_{\text{system}} \neq \emptyset$
* Signals are only visible where observer and system constraints align

## 6. The Inference Loop: From Signal to Structure

### 6.1 No Need for Full Phase Space

* Unlike classical mechanics, full microstate knowledge is not required
* Geometry of signal evolution encodes latent constraint shifts

### 6.2 Entropy Arcs and Bifurcations

* Use signal shape, entropy profile, and divergence transitions to identify structural events
* Application to sediment core layers, DOC time series, or post-disturbance PSDs

## 7. Integrating Information Geometry with Biogeochemical Models

* Statistical manifolds as extensions of process-based models
* Fisher-Rao and Wasserstein metrics as tools for constraint surface detection
* Linking observed divergence to known process changes (e.g., vegetation loss, channel erosion)

## 8. Application Scenarios

* Sediment core analysis (e.g., landslide-triggered reorganization)
* DOC/DIC after wildfire (constraint release and re-entrenchment)
* Streamflow signal transformation post-clearcut

## 9. Conceptual and Mathematical Summary

* Signals are not about states—they are **expressions of constraint evolution**
* System structure, function, and fluctuation **co-generate**
* Observation is **not passive**—it is structurally entangled
* Information geometry provides a **quantitative, observer-aware lens** for tracking system evolution
