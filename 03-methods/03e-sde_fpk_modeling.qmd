# SDE and FPK Modeling

## Motivation

This section illustrates how observing only probability distributions—without knowing the governing dynamics—can benefit from an information geometry approach.

## Simple SDE

- Brownian motion, OU process
- IG metrics over trajectories

## Toward FPK

- Use KDE or histogram to estimate PDFs
- FPK as evolution of distribution
- Limits of inference when dynamics are hidden
