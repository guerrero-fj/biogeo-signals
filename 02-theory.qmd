## From Trajectories to Distributions: Why Information Geometry?

In sedimentary and biogeochemical systems, the signals we observe—such as 
particle size distributions (PSDs), organic carbon content, or elemental 
ratios—emerge from the aggregation of numerous micro-interactions. These include
physical transport processes, fragmentation and aggregation, chemical 
transformations, and biological mediation. Modeling such systems deterministically 
would require resolving not only the trajectories of particles, but also their 
evolving chemical associations and interactions with flow and substrate. These 
interactions are complex, coupled, and often unobservable at the relevant scales.

As a result, the uncertainty in these systems is primarily **epistemic**: even 
if the underlying processes were deterministic in principle, our observational 
access to them is constrained by resolution, cost, and scale. We are not observing 
microstates; we are observing the **aggregate outcome** of many such microstates. 
This means that what we can reliably work with are **distributions**—empirical 
summaries over configurations that could have produced the observed signals.

Traditional modeling frameworks, such as **stochastic differential equations (SDEs)**, 
attempt to represent such systems as random processes evolving in continuous time. 
For example, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process (Uhlenbeck & Ornstein, 1930; Gardiner, 2009) 
models a system with random fluctuations and a tendency to return toward a 
long-term mean. SDEs describe the **trajectories** of hypothetical realizations 
of the system in state space.

However, these trajectories are rarely observable in complex environmental systems. 
What is typically observed is the **distribution of outcomes** across time or space. 
This distinction—between trajectories of individual realizations and the distributional 
shape of an ensemble—is critical. The **Fokker–Planck equation (FPE)** provides 
a bridge between the two: given an SDE, the FPE describes the time evolution of 
the **probability density function** of the system's state (Risken, 1996). In 
this sense, FPEs translate trajectory-level models into distribution-level dynamics.

But even FPE-based approaches face difficulties: they require specifying both drift 
and diffusion terms (often empirically unresolvable), and the resulting PDEs may 
be analytically or numerically intractable for high-dimensional or nonlinear systems.

This is where **information geometry (IG)** enters as a powerful alternative. IG 
bypasses the need to model the system’s microstate dynamics or solve PDEs. Instead, 
it treats the evolving distributions themselves as points on a **statistical manifold** 
(Amari & Nagaoka, 2000). Distances, divergences, and curvature on this manifold 
encode structural information about how the system’s constraints—and by extension, 
its organization—evolve over time. Rather than tracking individual paths or solving 
equations of motion, IG focuses on how the **shape of the signal distribution changes**, 
using tools like:

- **Shannon entropy** to quantify uncertainty,
- **Bhattacharyya and Wasserstein distances** to track distributional change,
- **Fisher information metrics** to capture sensitivity and curvature in the signal space.

This shape-based perspective aligns closely with the needs of watershed biogeochemistry, 
where disturbance events (e.g., wildfire, logging, landslides) often lead to 
qualitative shifts in signal distributions—introducing new modes, broadening tails, 
or compressing signal variance. Information geometry thus provides a principled 
framework for **analyzing, comparing, and interpreting distributions** without 
requiring access to the inaccessible.

> **Summary**: When system trajectories are unobservable and Fokker–Planck solutions 
are intractable, the geometry of evolving signal distributions offers a robust and 
scalable way to track constraint reorganization in disturbed watersheds.
